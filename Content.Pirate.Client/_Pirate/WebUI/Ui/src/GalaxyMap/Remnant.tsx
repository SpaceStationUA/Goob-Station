/**
 * What a star leaves behind.
 *
 * Four kinds, one family, and the family is the point:
 *
 *     star ──> dwarf        a core that stopped collapsing, still cooling
 *          └─> remnant      the explosion, and the shell it leaves
 *              └─> pulsar   a collapsed core, spinning, beams out of its poles
 *                  └─> blackhole   collapsed past the point of no return
 *
 * Every one of these is an observed object, and that was the test for adding any of
 * them. It is why there is no white hole here: a white hole solves the equations of
 * general relativity and nothing has ever been observed that requires one, which
 * makes it a different kind of thing to put on a map that otherwise shows real
 * objects in real positions.
 *
 * ## Why the pulsar is canvas 2D and not a shader
 *
 * Because it does not need one. A pulsar is a hard point with two soft beams, and
 * that is gradients — which canvas draws with a handful of `createRadialGradient`
 * calls and WebGL would need a whole program for. The black hole and the ring are
 * shaders because they are *carved by noise*, which is a different problem: the
 * shader is not there for speed, it is there because the reference's shapes cannot be
 * drawn any other way without losing the divisions in them.
 *
 * The one thing here that IS animated is the beam sweep, and it is the only animation
 * on this chart. That is deliberate and it is the pulsar's actual signature — a
 * pulsar is distinguished from every other kind of neutron star by the fact that its
 * emission is beamed and rotating. Draw it as a static dot and it is just a small
 * bright thing, which is what a white dwarf is.
